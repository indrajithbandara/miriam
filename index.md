# TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

> "You hear, you remember, you do and you understand, you teach and you know."
Helen Tyas Tunggal ( Retired principal at Harwood Island School)

Teaching is about facilitating a passion for lifelong learning. It is equipping students with the skills for problem-solving and creating an environment of inquiry that uses creative thinking to examine, solve and innovate.

It is my role as a teacher to create a positive learning environment, one that promotes inquiry,  one that is safe and one that embraces students who may come from a broad range of linguistic/ cultural backgrounds as well as abilities.

I endeavor to meet my students where they are, provide clearly scaffolded lessons that are proximal to their needs through knowing my students and how they learn.

I endeavor to foster an environment where students can work together toward their learning goals eventually bringing these skills of collaboration out to the wider community.

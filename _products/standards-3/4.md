Select and/or create and use a range of resources, including ICT, to engage students in their learning.

When teaching composition to my year four Music class I engage a range of resources
I put the students in groups and showed the students moving graphic patterns.

The students were then asked to represent these moving graphics in a recorded sample of sounds using found sound objects collected from the playground and the classroom as well as their voices.  

We used Garageband to record these short representative pieces. The class then came together to listen to each groups work and through analysis match each composition to each  graphic went with each of the pieces of music and to explain how they came to this conclusion.

Similarly I got my students to create graphic notation charts, using colours, images and height to represent pieces of music that they analysed. Above is an image of what they came up with.

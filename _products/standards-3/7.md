At Pelangi school ( where I have done the majority of my practicum) there is a strong relationship between parents of the children and the school. This has resulted in the school not only being a centre for learning but a centre for community.

Aside from regularly newsletters to parents and homework books, parents are involved in number of events supporting school life.

Parents are also able to come in and support the reading program.

One of them (pictured )was the school's 20 year anniversary and fundraiser - Were aside from taking part in the organization parents and other family members were able to come together as a community.

Select and use relevant teaching strategies to develop knowledge, skills, problem solving and critical and creative thinking.

When I teach I use strategies that engage the students to know rather than memorize material.
This involves examining a question, interpreting it, and finding creative ways to a solution.
Often this means applying what they know to real life examples. When I teach I aim to
Challenge Students to Know, rather than memorize:

- Question, Examine, Create, Solve, Interpret, Debate

- Active Classes are Purposeful and Well Organized

- Students THINK About What They Learn

- Apply Material to Real Situations (e.g., Case Studies)

- Students Continue to Learn Independentlyâ€¦

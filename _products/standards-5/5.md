Demonstrate an understanding of a range of strategies for reporting to students and parents/carers and the purpose of keeping accurate and reliable records of student achievement.

Reports for students, parents, and carers should be concise and clear.  

A student's achievements should be clearly reported against the curriculum standards.

The report should also suit the needs of the individual student and the community. It should also consider the effort, aptitude and school policy.

Teacher-parent interviews

Teacher-parent interviews are also extremely important for consultation on student achievement.

Within these interviews, one should:

- Begin an interview with a positive comment.
- Identify the assessment outcomes clearly.
- Be able to show collected evidence to back up comments
- Discuss the students preferred learning medium and pertinent concerns.

Other strategies for reporting student achievement include:

- The creation of student portfolios
- Celebrating achievements in newsletters, assemblies and at speech nights
- Consistent feedback and recording of homework progress.

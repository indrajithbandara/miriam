Having taught at Pelangi International school in Bali Indonesia - A school with a student base that came from a broad range of cultural and religious backgrounds from other countries and also within Indonesia, it was a great opportunity to celebrate these differences by studying the music of other cultures within Indonesia.

Using the knowledge I have gleaned about my class, I plan detailed programs to meet their individual needs.

We used the excellent resource provided by Music Aviva where the children learned the fable and instrumentation behind the Javanese song "Lir i lir" and all learned to sing the song in this language together.

This also leads to a class discussion with my fourth-grade class about the languages represented in their classroom as well as songs from their own cultures.

The experience of the whole class learning a song in a different language that most of them did not know gave all students an opportunity to experience first-hand what it is like to learn in a second language.

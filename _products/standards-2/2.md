I always consult the Australian Curriculum and related content to plan and implement lessons.  My lessons are taught in a way that is sequential where by learning is built upon in a logical and sequential manner.  Where possible I also endeavor to link ideas across curriculum areas.

I clearly state the outcomes of my lessons to my students using language that is specific to the task. This gives them context to the lesson. I also clearly state my modes of assessment so that students are aware of their expectations.

See my detailed lesson plan example and study unit plan  example for more details.

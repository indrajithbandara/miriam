In an increasingly digital world it is important that students are fully equipped with the knowledge of how to use the internet for advancement as we all as knowledge of how to navigate the perils of online information in this ever changing medium.

As outlined in the Victoria  Safe and responsible use of technologies website a link of which is supplied below.  

Within my role as class teacher it is paramount to:

- Develop digital media literacy which includes positive online communication, peer and personal safety.

- Developing positive online behaviors - polite address, protecting personal information, having adult supervision and where possible a filter

- Equipping students with an awareness of cyberbullying, how to respond to it, the role of the bystander.

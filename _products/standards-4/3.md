It is my role to facilitate a positive learning environment at all times. One where students feel safe and able to contribute to the learning experience with each other.
I use a number of strategies in order to manage challenging behavior when it arises.

At the beginning of working with a new group or at the beginning of a new term, I work together with the group to establish a code of conduct  - A do’s and don’ts list that is analyzed and agreed upon by the group. This code of conduct is made visible and able to be referred to at all times.  This also creates ownership by the group of these standards

Aside from the poster I get students to write or take home a copy of the behavioral points as a contract which they take home sign and then get read and signed by a parent or guardian they are then accountable for their behavior at all times.

I also have seating plans where I split up students that tend to have behavior and concentration issues when seated together. I set up this seating arrangement to be as non confrontational as possible.

Demonstrate an understanding of the role of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers in identifying professional learning needs.

This entire portfolio seeks to demonstrate that I have a clear understanding of the professional standards for teachers and through creating it, I have most certainly become acutely aware of my professional learning needs as the ACARA resource is at the foundation of my portfolio.

As a graduate teacher it is most important that there is explicit guidance in identifying learning needs. This can be found in great detail in the [Curriculum](https://www.aitsl.edu.au/teach/standards) which has been my main resource for creating this portfolio.

The other most important resources in identifying my learning needs have been the schools where i have taught in my practicums and fellow staff, teaching mentors and student colleagues.

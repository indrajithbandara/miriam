Aside from my general study through CDU and learning through practicums at three vastly different schools. During the course of my study at CDU i have also attended a week long course through the Sydney Symphony helping general primary teachers to teach the music curriculum with innovation and confidence. I then did a follow up course with them called Topped up.

Aside from this, during the course of my education studies at CDU I completed the first level of Kodally Music teacher training course which is a comprehensive methodology that addresses teaching music literacy and aural training to primary school aged students.  

I have applied the ideas that I learned at these courses directly to my prac teaching. These courses have innovated my style, given me confidence and broadened my knowledge in my area of greatest interest - the arts.

I have developed a strong rapport with many of the teachers at Pelangi Schooly (where I have done the majority of my practicum). These veteran teachers  have the wealth of years of experience to share.  

This rapport coupled with a respect and genuine interest in what they have to share on the subject of education, has meant that I have been able to go into their classes and observe them teaching.  This gives me many ideas on how to better my own teaching practice

I am constantly open to feedback from my mentor who has attended lessons of mine at different stages of my practicum and given me both verbal and written feedback on areas of my teaching.  My mentor informs me on what I am doing well as well as the practices  that I can improve upon.

This is continually invaluable to my development as a teacher.

I also attend staff meetings, take part in group staff discussions and staff planning days.
